Hello Y'all
  Just wanted to drop in and say I am a true evangelist of computer science education for all. I was there before there was a code.org.
  Now we have people all over the place who know nothing about computer science touting  their expertise and working in areas they have not business doing  this is going to cause computer science to go the way of math in this country.  Where kids hate programming instead of loving it.
